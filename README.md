This repository contains a simple example of an implicit type casting error in Hack. The function `foo` does not explicitly declare the return type, causing an error when the function is called with an integer argument. This is because Hack does not allow implicit casting of an integer value to a float type. The solution demonstrates how to explicitly declare the return type of the function to avoid this error.
